npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist/public
```

### Option 2: Drag & Drop
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Go to Netlify dashboard
3. Drag the `dist/public` folder to deploy

## üåê Domain Configuration

### Custom Domain
1. Go to **Site settings ‚Üí Domain management**
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed
4. SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

- You can customize the subdomain in site settings

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### Build Logs
- View deployment logs in **Deploys** tab
- Monitor build status and errors
- Access function logs for API debugging

### Performance
- Lighthouse scores available in dashboard
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Asset optimization suggestions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs for specific errors
# Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
